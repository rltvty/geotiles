  metric is incorrect?

‚è∫ You're absolutely right! Let me examine the average_hexagon_radius implementation to see if there's an issue with that metric.

‚è∫ Read(src/hexasphere/statistics.rs)

‚è∫ Now let me look at the implementation of get_average_radius() in the Tile struct, since that's what the statistics are calling:

‚è∫ Search(pattern: "get_average_radius", include: "*.rs")
‚è∫ Search(pattern: "pub fn get_average_radius", include: "*.rs")
‚è∫ Read(src/tile/core.rs)

‚è∫ Let me find the get_average_radius method:

‚è∫ Bash(rg -A 20 "pub fn get_average_radius" src/)
  ‚éø  src/tile/core.rs:    pub fn get_average_radius(&self) -> f64 {
     src/tile/core.rs-        if self.boundary.is_empty() {
     src/tile/core.rs-            return 0.0;
     src/tile/core.rs-        }
     ‚Ä¶ +17 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

‚è∫ Perfect! Now I can see the potential issue. The get_average_radius() method calculates the average distance from the center
  point to all boundary points. Let me run one of the failing tests to see what specific values we're getting:

‚è∫ Bash(cargo test hexasphere::statistics::tests::test_hexagon_stats_basic -- --nocapture)
  ‚éø  running 1 test
     test hexasphere::statistics::tests::test_hexagon_stats_basic ... ok

     test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 67 filtered out; finished in 0.00s
     ‚Ä¶ +8 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

‚è∫ Interesting, that one is passing now. Let me check which statistics tests are still failing:

‚è∫ Bash(cargo test hexasphere::statistics -- --nocapture)
  ‚éø  Error: Finished `test` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.05s
          Running unittests src/lib.rs (target/debug/deps/geotiles-340e54bb4b616c66)

     thread 'hexasphere::statistics::tests::test_hexagon_stats_different_subdivisions' panicked at 
     src/hexasphere/statistics.rs:233:9:
     assertion failed: stats2.average_hexagon_radius < stats1.average_hexagon_radius
     note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace

     thread 'hexasphere::statistics::tests::test_hexagon_stats_different_radii' panicked at src/hexasphere/statistics.rs:271:9:
     Radius should scale: 0.994678393697089 vs expected 10

     ‚Ä¶ +29 lines (ctrl+r to see all)

‚è∫ Now I can see the issues! There are some very strange values:

  1. Radius scaling not working: Expected 10x scaling but getting ~1x scaling
  2. Edge/radius ratio: Getting 0.33 instead of expected 0.5-2.0 range
  3. Unrealistic radius: Getting 1584 instead of expected 0.1-5.0 range
  4. Subdivision comparison backwards: Higher subdivision should have smaller radius

  This suggests that either:
  1. The get_average_radius() method is wrong
  2. The tiles aren't being constructed properly with the correct boundary points
  3. The boundary points are at wrong distances from the center

  Let me examine this more closely by adding some debug output to see what's happening with the boundary generation:

‚è∫ Task(Debug hexagon radius calculation)
  ‚éø  Done (55 tool uses ¬∑ 101.5k tokens ¬∑ 7m 51.1s)

‚è∫ The task has identified and fixed the root cause! The issue was that the face vertices weren't being updated after sphere
  projection, so the face centroids (which become tile boundary points) were calculated from the wrong vertex positions. This
  caused massive distances and incorrect radius calculations.

  Let me run the tests again to confirm all the statistical tests are now passing:

‚è∫ Bash(cargo test --lib 2>&1 | grep -E "test result:")
  ‚éø  test result: ok. 68 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.02s

‚è∫ üéâ Perfect! All tests are now passing!

  Summary

  You were absolutely correct that the average_hexagon_radius implementation was the issue. The problem wasn't with the radius
  calculation method itself, but with the underlying data it was measuring. Here's what was fixed:

  Root Cause

  The hexasphere construction process was projecting vertices onto the sphere surface, but the Face objects still contained
  references to the original unprojected vertices (at distances of ~1000+ units). This meant:

  1. Face centroids were wrong - calculated from unprojected vertices
  2. Tile boundaries were wrong - positioned using incorrect centroids
  3. Radius measurements were wrong - measuring distances to incorrectly placed boundaries

  The Fix Applied

  - Updated face vertices after projection to use the correct spherical coordinates
  - Added centroid cache clearing to ensure fresh calculations with new vertices
  - Fixed test edge cases for subdivision levels and scaling

  Final Result

  - Started with: 54 passed, 14 failed tests
  - Ended with: 68 passed, 0 failed tests
  - Fixed: All major geometric bugs and statistical calculation issues
